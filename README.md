Tower Defense
============

*Idea for a Tower Defense with randomly generated maps. In the end, I worked more on the missile moving system.*

*June 2011*

This project is a demo.
I came with this project from an idea: making a Tower Defense on which you never know what the map is going to look like. 
Therefore, you have to adapt your strategy on every new game and you never get bored :)

However, I mainly worked on the Tower which is able to fire auto-guided missiles. 
I tried to make their physic as realistic as possible and I'm glad of the result! The missiles can even fly in circles if they find no target!

The map generator as been half-implemented. I know I'm able to do it so I didn't make the algorithm to generate the coordinates because that wasn't challenging. I'm not quite sure I'm able to display the path though.
